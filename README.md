# Dino
My own implementation of the Google Chrome dinosaur game.

## Description
This is a small project I'm working on to learn and implement NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). So far, I have implemented my own version of the Google Chrome dinosaur game using Pygame.

## Install
This project requires Python 3.7 and pygame installed.

## Usage
To try out the script, simply run the command :
    
    python dino.py
